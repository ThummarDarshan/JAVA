# 🧠 Java OOP Mini Project

Welcome to our **Java OOP** project! This is a beginner-friendly, educational project designed to help college students understand the **core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming** — not just in theory, but through fun, hands-on coding.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

This project helps you master:

🔹 **Encapsulation** – Keep your data safe and sound  
🔹 **Inheritance** – Pass on the good stuff  
🔹 **Polymorphism** – Same method, different vibes  
🔹 **Abstraction** – Hide the complexity, show the purpose  
🔹 **Interfaces** – Java’s version of “multiple inheritance”

## 🏗️ Project Overview
